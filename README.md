Cognito Quickstart
===================================================

## What does this app do?
![QuickStart Angular2 Cognito App](/aws/meta/Cognito-Angular2-QuickStart.png?raw=true)


## AWS Setup
##### Install the required tools (the installation script only runs on Linux and Mac)
* Create an AWS account
* Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [Install or update your aws cli](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html) 
* [Install or update your eb cli](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html) 
* [Install angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)


## Getting the code and running it locally

```
# Clone it from github
git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:joshsisley/agency-web-app.git
```
```
# Install the NPM packages
cd agency-web-app
npm install
```
```
# Run the app in dev mode
npm start
```

## Creating AWS Resources
This sample application can be deployed to either Elastic Beanstalk or S3. S3 will host this application as a static site
while Elastic Beanstalk gives you the capability of adding backend operations to the application. 

* [What is Elastic Beanstalk](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/Welcome.html)
* [What is S3](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Welcome.html)

**createResources.sh requires your [aws cli to be configured](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/controlling-output.html) for JSON output.**

```
# Install the AWS resources and deploy your application to either Elastic Beanstalk or S3
cd aws
./createResources.sh
```

Running the above command will create the necessary AWS resources and build & deploy your code to AWS. 
It will prompt you to choose your deployment target (S3 or Elastic Beanstalk). Choosing 'S3' makes your deployment
completely serverless, while choosing Elastic Beanstalk will create an EC2 instance that will host this NodeJS app. 

*Caution:* You might incur AWS charges after running the setup script

## After initially running the ```createResources.sh``` script, use the below commands to rebuild and redeploy

### _S3:_ Update, Build and Deploy
```
# Build the project and sync the output with the S3 bucket
npm run build; cd dist; aws s3 sync . s3://[BUCKET_NAME]/
```
```
# Test your deployed application
curl â€“I http://[BUCKET_NAME].s3-website-[REGION].amazonaws.com/
```
__*NOTE: You might want to reshuffle some of the "package.json" dependencies and move the ones that belong to devDependencies 
for a leaner deployment bundle. At this point of time, AWS Beanstalk requires all of the dependencies, 
including the devDependencies to be under the dependencies section. But if you're not using Beanstalk then you can
optimize as you wish.*__

*or*

### _Beanstalk:_ Update, Build and Deploy
```
# Commit your changes in order to deploy it to your environment
git add .
git commit
eb deploy
```
```
# View your deployed application in a browser
eb open
```
